# Covid Vaccination Progress
I gathered this data through [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpreda/covid-world-vaccination-progress), however, this was originally collected through [Github](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data). 
## Purpose
I used this data to determine which countries used what vaccines, and which countries were top/bottom in terms of vaccine usage.
## Process
RStudio was used for data analysis where I performed various functions such as format manipulations, merging, etc.
